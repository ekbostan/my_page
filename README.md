# my_page
This is a personal website project that I created using Django for the backend and JS/CSS/HTML for the frontend. The website showcases my portfolio, skills, and contact information.

The frontend is designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which makes the website dynamic and interactive. It has a modern and clean design with responsive layouts that adapt to different screen sizes. Users can easily navigate through different pages and sections to learn more about my work and achievements. The homepage has a hero section that introduces me and provides links to my social media profiles. The portfolio section displays my projects with images and descriptions, and the skills section showcases my expertise in various areas.

The backend is built using the Django web framework, which provides a robust and scalable infrastructure for managing user authentication, database administration, and server-side scripting. The application uses a SQLite database to store user data, project information, and other relevant details.

This project showcases my skills in both frontend and backend development, as well as my ability to create a professional and engaging personal website.
